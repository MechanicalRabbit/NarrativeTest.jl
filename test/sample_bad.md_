# Some tests with errors

We let the first test pass:

    (3+4)*6     #-> 42

But the next test should fail:

    2+2         #-> 5

This test should raise an exception:

    sqrt(-1)    #-> 0.0 + 1.0im

This one is ill-formed:

    #-> test code is missing

Another test which should fail:

    julia> 42
    43

And yet another ill-formed:

    julia>
