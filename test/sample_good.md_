# Some passing tests

We can check if an expression evaluates to an expected value:

    (3+4)*6         #-> 42

We could also check if some code produces expected output:

    print(2^16)     #-> 65536

We could use ellipsis to match a sequence of characters:

    collect(1:10)   #-> [1, 2, …, 10]

We could use specify tests using syntax simulating REPL session:

    julia> (3+4)*6
    42
